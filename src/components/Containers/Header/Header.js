        <p className="animation">a software developer based
         in London.
         <br></br>
       
        If you where expecting one of those fancy portfolios with high-resolution images and too many animations that all look the same ,
        y regret to disappoint you but that's not me.
        <br></br>
        
        I write code yes, but most of it run under the hood,  therefore you can't see it,
        I could show you some snippets or you could go to my Github profile and take a peek.
        <br></br>
         Don't forget less is more :)
